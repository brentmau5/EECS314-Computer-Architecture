{\bf a}.
\begin{align*}
AMAT &= Hit Time + Miss Rate * Miss Penalty \\
AMAT &= 2 + .05 * 20 * 2 = 4 ns
\end{align*}

{\bf b}.
\begin{align*}
CPU Time_a &= IC * (2 + 1.5 * 20 * .05) * 2   = 7 * IC \\
CPU Time_b &= IC * (2 + 1.5 * 20 * .03) * 2.4 = 6.96 * IC
\end{align*}

Because the times are almost identical, the there is no gain from doing this.

Compulsory, capacity and conflict misses should be reduced if the program is written to require less memory. Increased clock speed will not have an effect on misses regardless of type, but associativity should reduce conflict misses.
